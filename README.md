# Casualties Hub Mod Manager

> A Pre-Alpha mod manager and launcher for **Casualties Unknown**.

Casualties Hub helps players browse mod metadata, manage local BepInEx plugins, protect custom assets, share mod setups, and identify common dependency or compatibility issues.

## ⚠ Pre-Alpha Status

Casualties Hub is functional but still under active development.

Expect unfinished features, bugs, and UI changes. Please back up important custom assets and mods before testing new builds.

The newest stable public release and available Pre-Release builds can be found on the [Releases page](../../releases).

## Download and Installation

1. Open the [Releases page](../../releases).
2. Download the version you want under **Assets**.
3. Extract the ZIP somewhere outside `Program Files`.
4. Run `Casualties Hub.exe`.
5. On first launch, configure the Casualties Unknown game folder in **Settings** if it is not detected automatically.

Older builds remain available for rollback and testing.

## Protected Assets

Protected Assets are files or folders that Casualties Hub saves separately so they can be restored after reinstalling or replacing mods.

This is useful for custom sprites, character folders, skins, sounds, and similar personal files.

> Protected Assets are kept locally on your PC. They are not uploaded by Casualties Hub.

## Online Services

Online Services are optional.

When enabled, Casualties Hub can retrieve:

- Hub announcements.
- Compatibility and known-bug information.
- Launcher update availability.

When disabled, local mod management and Protected Assets continue to work. Saved announcements and local files remain available.

## Known Issues

- Some Share Code requested mods may not yet provide an install option.
- Some Nexus links may open a mod's main page rather than its specific download page.
- Certain mod archives use custom layouts and may still require manual installation.
- Opera GX may not automatically open or come to the foreground when Casualties Hub opens a browser link.
- Dependency and compatibility information is community-maintained and may be incomplete.
